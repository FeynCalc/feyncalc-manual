\texttt{D0Convention} is an option for \texttt{Write2}. If set to
\texttt{1}, the convention for the arguments of \texttt{D0} is changed
when writing a Fortran file with \texttt{Write2}: The fifth and sixth
argument of \texttt{D0} are interchanged and the square root is taken of
the last four arguments.
